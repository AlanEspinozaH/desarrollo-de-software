Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.g1 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "g1" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "c42da3f8-e9b9-4d97-9f3a-1c9584176af2"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T08:00:14.566970"
        }
    }

  # null_resource.g2 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "g2" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "36bc6734-3654-4db4-93a6-79a88f11df64"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T08:00:14.566990"
        }
    }

  # null_resource.g3 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "g3" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "307667a9-0741-4eb7-9dde-ef334d3be3c6"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T08:00:14.566999"
        }
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
