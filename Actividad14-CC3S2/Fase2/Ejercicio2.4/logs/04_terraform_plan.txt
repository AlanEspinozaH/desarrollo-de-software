Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.c1 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "c1" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "68c580ed-840c-4c4e-8641-7596c8a12868"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T07:35:26.795268"
        }
    }

  # null_resource.c2 will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "c2" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "385b0bc6-3ac3-474b-9987-46348541e7a7"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T07:35:26.795286"
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
