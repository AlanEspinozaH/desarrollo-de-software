Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.welcome will be created
  + resource "local_file" "welcome" {
      + content              = <<-EOT
            Welcome from Prototype mutator
        EOT
      + content_base64sha256 = (known after apply)
      + content_base64sha512 = (known after apply)
      + content_md5          = (known after apply)
      + content_sha1         = (known after apply)
      + content_sha256       = (known after apply)
      + content_sha512       = (known after apply)
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "./welcome.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # null_resource.proto_base will be created
  + resource "null_resource" "proto_base" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + triggers = {
          + "factory_uuid" = "f20ee884-74c3-4cef-9e58-8fa4e5b8883a"
          + "timestamp"    = "2025-12-23T07:13:20.811484"
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
